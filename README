QUICK GUIDE:

+ M-QAM_Simulation.m
  
  It simulates the system and estimates a BER for an SNR given. Type of 
  M-QAM used is selected as well.
  Input data:

	- longitud: amount of bits to be tested
	- M: deepness of modulation. 1 = 4-QAM, 2 = 16-QAM, 3 = 64-QAM, ..
	- SNR: Signal Noise Ratio for the AWGN channel in dB.

	Example: M-QAM_Simulation(100,2,10)

+ M-QAM_Election.m

  It analyses several QAM modulation schemas to choose the one which 
  gives us more binary speed. SNR of channel and a max BER are given.
  Input data:

	- SNR - Signal Noise Ratio for the AWGN Channel in dB. 
	- BitErr - Maximun BER allowed.
	
	Example: M-QAM_Election(5,0.01)

+ M-QAM_Comparison.m

  It analyses several QAM modulation schemas returning the Bit Error Rate
  from each one. SNR is given.
  Input data:

	- SNR - Signal Noise Ratio for the AWGN Channel in dB.

	Example: M-QAM_Comparison(5)
